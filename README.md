This project involves building and interactive Credit Risk Analysis Dashboard in Excel to evaluate loan default risk across 32K+ applicants. This work includes cleaning and transforming the dataset, handling missing values and engineering key risk indicators such as risk level, income group, interest rate band and credit history band. Pivot Tables, KPI cards and slicers were used to create a dynamic dashboard that analyzes risk distribution by loan grade, loan intent, income level, and historical default behavior. The final dashboard provides clear, decision ready insights, highlighting high risk customer segments and supporting data driven credit risk assessment.
